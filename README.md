## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Roll the Dice**: Each player takes turns rolling a single dice as many times as they want during their turn.
2. **Accumulate Points**: Every time you roll, your points for that round add up.
3. **Beware of 1**: If you roll a `1`, your current round score resets to zero, and it's your opponent's turn.
4. **Hold Your Points**: Choose to hold and save your round points to your total score. The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game!
